Key Considerations
Indexing: Add indexes on:

users.email, users.phone_number
artisan_profiles.user_id
artisan_profiles.location_city, latitude, longitude (for geo searches)
artisan_profiles.average_rating, total_jobs_completed
artisan_profiles.verification_status

Security:

Encrypt sensitive fields: account_number, id_document_url
Hash passwords with bcrypt/argon2
Use UUID instead of auto-increment IDs (harder to enumerate)

Computed Fields:
Some fields like average_rating, total_reviews can be calculated on-the-fly or cached in the profile table for performance.
Soft Deletes:
Include deleted_at for users who deactivate accounts (for compliance/recovery)
